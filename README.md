# LLM PDF Chat Bot
Hello. This is my first personal project in which I explored Rag and use of LLMs (llama 3.1) in creating a chat bot which provides answers to user queries from a pdf file.
To use this project you need to have ollama and llama 3.1 installed locally on your machine.
features that I'm looking forward to add to this project are:
1. paragraph segmentation and embedding, which can be used instead of the current page segmentation.(DONE)
2. A FastAPI interface to upload pdfs.
